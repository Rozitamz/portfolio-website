                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Tehran, a city rich with history, vibrant culture, and inspiring architecture, I moved to the U.S. in 2016 to pursue new opportunities. Since then, I have worked in sales, customer service, and fashion design, where I cultivated a deep appreciation for creativity, problem-solving, and connecting with people.

                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy planting, pattern-making, and listening to music that fuels my creativity. My passions include fashion design, staying active, traveling, art, and hiking. Empathy and helping others have always been guiding principles in my life, shaping how I approach design and collaboration.

                <p>
                    Now, as a UX/UI designer with a strong background in sales, management, and teaching, I bring a unique perspective to crafting user-centric solutions. My experiences have given me a solid foundation in understanding user needs, solving diverse problems, and creating intuitive designs that enhance user experiences. I am excited to leverage my skills to turn complex ideas into simple, impactful products.Born and raised in Tehran, a city brimming with culture and history, I moved to the U.S. in 2016 to explore new opportunities.
